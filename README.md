# Learning_Material_Recommender
This project builds a content-based recommendation system for academic essays using the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus. The system compares a user-provided document (e.g., a .docx essay) or free-form text with essays in the BAWE dataset and recommends the most similar essays.
